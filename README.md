# VBA-challenge

Assignment and Challenge completed.

Script runs on test dataset in less than 30sec - that's looping through all the 7 sheets with result.

Three subroutines in the VBAStock.bas file.

i. VBAStock - this macro includes the assignment and both challenges.  On one click this script loops through each worksheet, executes the assignment and the challenge.

ii. WorksheetLoop - this macro is a basic test to loop through each sheet and output sheet name.

iii. Challenge - this macro executes just the challenge part, runs only on active sheet.
